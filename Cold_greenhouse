Cold Greenhouse
I
In the back drawing-room of the house in
Stuyvesant Square, /\ ^in which they had been born & brought up^ the two sisters, Cornelia 
& Phoebe Legree, sat engaged in ladylike
pursuits. Cornelia was making a tatted
lace collar, & Phoebe, her [?], painting
a text from the Sermon on the Mount
on a sheet of rice paper.
	The February day was very [?], with /\ ^intermittent^
swirls of sleet & a hard [?] sky
threatening snow; & their stepmother, had
decreed^ing^ that the girls should not go out
& had suggested their occupying /\ ^their afternoon^ themselves
with painting & fancy-work. instead Both
had delicate chests, & it worried Mrs. 
Legree when they were out in bad weather. 
	Call Cornelia Legree was forty ^one^, & her
sister Phoebe only two years younger; but
it would not have occurred to either
of them to disobey. There was nothing
they feared more than to “worry” their
stepmother. She had been so kind to so incessantly

2
& relentlessly kind to them, ever since
their ^widowed^ father had married her, when they were
both little orphaned ^motherless^ girls, & their brother
Charlie (who had cost his mother’s ^her^ life)
/\ ^was^ still in long-clothes.
	That was thirty-five years ago; & Charlie ^their^
was dead father was long since dead; &
Charlie was dead too – killed at [?]
in the Civil War; & the two gils ^“girls”^ &
their step-mother had lived /\ ^alone^ together for
so long that sometimes Cornelia Legree
almost forgot that the household had
ever been a larger one. Her father &
brother – dearly as she /\ ^had^ loved [??] –
had played ^had^ a very small part ^share^ in her
life compared with /\ ^the part^ her step-mother had
played in it. Ever since Catherine
Legree had entered the family she
had decided everything concerning the
children. Her husband, Gerrit Legree,
was a very imposing man, with 
a head like a bronze ^marble^ bust in a rather
[?] light; he was six feet tall, &

3
/|\ ^admirably erect &^ always perfectly dressed, & when his
wife Magdalena Gerrit died, people ^New York^
were was deeply moved at the sight
of the stately young widower walking behind
the coffin with his two little girls in 
bombazine. When he married his per
Catherine Westrop he lost a little ^something^
of his prestige for there were many ^was more than one^ ^well to^
young ladies from /\ ^handsome heiress, between^ the Bowery to and
Usu Washington Square, who would
have been ready & happy to replace
poor Magdalena; & Catherine Westrop
though of excellent ^good^ family was exceedingly
poor & almost regarded as a dependent
m ^by^ the great clan of Geritts & Legree
with ^to^ whom she was distantly connected ^affiliated^ ^related^.
The Westrops were so badly off that they
had had to go & live in New Jersey, 
& Catherine’s father had been a 
country doctor. New York did not
need any further explanation.
Catherine used to be sent for when
people were ill or there was any trouble

4
in the house. Unfortu ^When Magdalena died^ some old Gerrit
grandmother aunt suggested the widower’s
sending for her; but & unfortunately
she stayed.
	But if one had used the term “un-
fortunately” to Cornelia or Legree she 
would have resented it. She Her
stepmother had been an angel to them
all. Every one knew it now, Every one
acknowledged it. What would their lives
have been without her? It was true, 
there had she had had her preferences; she
had never been as kind to Charlie as
the girls. But young men will be young men.
Cornelia /\ ^with a^ timorously glancing sideways ^sideward glance^ 
at the question, had supposed that
was the reason of her step-mother’s comparative
coldness. Mrs. Legree’s standards were
high; terribly high; ^even^ “the girls” ^[?] yearning^ years
up to them, with the chill air of “what
[?] father would have said” perpect
perpetually ripping their spring buds,
guessed that Charlie required a 
warmer temperature. But they had

5
to admit that Mrs. Legree was never unkind
to Charlie. She only looked sad about him – 
at times. And at his death-bed, when
he lay wounded mortally wounded in 
the best military hospital at
Washington, how beautifully they she
had spoken – how humbly! “Can
you ever forgive me, Charles?” they had
heard her say; & she had stooped &
kissed him on the forehead. He
was nearly gone already; her kiss was
the last he fe had. No; she Cornelia
coul would never admit that her
step-mother had been unjust to Charles…
	“Girls!” a clear voice called. “Come
here a minute, will you please?” The
door opened, & they saw Mrs. Legree
standing on the threshold in her
long black draperies. She had never
left off her mourning for their father.

Mrs. Gerrit Haverford ^Legree’s^ drawing room,
in Stuyvesant with its long windows opening
the mild spring sunshine of ^on^ Stuyvesant
Square, was considered an example of
sober elegance in decoration.
The pale grey wall-paper had a convolvulus
design in lushous silk ^mauve and silver [?]^ /|\ ^lilac^, & the carpet was
pale grey also, with a border representing
a heavy gilt picture frame within
which pale flowers wound in blue & pink
wreaths about a grey trellis.
A mahogan rose-wood center table
with a white marble top bore a lamp in
engraved glass with crystal fringes & a
number of volumes of poetry ^poetical selections^ in Morocco 
bindings embossed in ^with^ Cathedral designs.
/|\ ^On the mantel,^ alabaster vases from Pisa flanked the 
gold charioteer ^marble apollo^ on the mantel /\ ^in^ whose
chariot well wheel ^gilt^ chariot a clock-case
was inset. The room, though thus subdued
in tone, was not [?]  d ^[?]^ daring [?] ^novelty^
[?] for behind the sofa which stood
near the fireplace had been placed a 
long green ^[?]^ box ^painted green, and^ backed by a gilt trellis
over which tradescantia was trained.
A row of pale primroses ^hyacinthes^ filled the front of
the box. The idea, brought from Paris, was

2
Mrs. Haverford’s ^Catherine Legree’s^ one innovation &, like
all who seldom venture, she was criticized 
when she did, & the consensus of opinion, 
from Washington to Union Square, was
that the effect of the screen was theatrical, 
& that the proper place for flowers ^plants^ was
in the garden or the cold greenhouse.
	Mrs. Haverford ^Legree^ had a cold green-
house in the large back-yard behind the 
house /\ ^as she had [???]^ She would have liked to put a 
stove in it, for she was fond of gardening
& interested in exotic plants; but
the years passed without her venturing to 
suggest it to her husband, & then he died,
and /\ ^as she told the girls^ she felt that all should ^ought to^ remain as
it had been in his lifetime. She had always
felt this ^especially^ about her /\ ^step^ children, to whose
bringing-up the best years of her youth
had been devoted, & the feeling extended
to anything in her life, even to the 
cold green-house, where she worked on 
warm winter days, with her ^long pale^ hands in 
gauntlet gloves & a /\ ^black woollen scarf wound^  knitted shawl [?]
over her widow’s cap.
	Now she sat in p her pale drawing-

3
room, in the pale March light, & looked
with a passionate [?] at a
tall flowering-plant on the table
before her. It shot up, from a base of
blue-green blade-like foliage into 
a great toppling cluster of blossoms,
red, pink, & coral-rose pure ^rich^ as the 
lights ^glow^ of a summer ^an August^ sunrise ^set^.
	“Ah-” she murmured, “But of course
Mr. Ingolt, it would never do in a
cold green-house.”
	Mr. Ingolt, a small dry man of middle-
age, who stood beside the plant, looked
down on it & then, respectfully, at the 
widow’s pure long [?] as she bent above
the flowers.
	“I do assure you, madame, that [?]
nerines do well in a cold green-house; 
though, of course, with a little fire they
bloom earlier…”
	“Oh, I shall never have any fire,” said
Mrs. Haverford, almost nervously.
	“No, I understand, madame. [??]

4
will come along in May. “I
	Mrs. Haverford ^Legree^ looked at the radiant
flowers wistfully. Then she ope crossed
the heavy [?]  of the carpet & 
opened a ^the^ door of the back drawing-room. 
	“Phoebe, Neelie,” she said /\ ^with authority yet^ not ungently.
	Two tall young women rose from 
a table at which one had been embroidering,
the other paining ^a text^ with ^in^ water-colours
mixed with green, on a sheet of Japanese
rice paper.
The age of the two sisters might have
been placed anywhere between twenty-
five and forty. There were moments when 
they still looked like pale ro delicate
girls, then when they appeared older
than their beautiful step-mother. Both
had regular features, smooth brown
hair, incredibly slim wrists & ankles,
& undeveloped bosoms. But the black-
eye-brows of Cornelia, instead of 
matching her hair, were almost black, 
& when she frowned-as she often did, from
shyness, perplexity, short-sightedness, 

5
& a general sense of inadequacy, they
met in a sharp black circumflex 
between above her drooping nose,
& transformed her extremely feminine 
face into a sort of parody of the
frowning bristling portrait of old
Derek Gerrit, whose high-stocked
portrait hung on the drawing-room wall. 
	Phoebe had no such eye-brows. She
was all in /\ ^sepia^ [?] of soft-brown ^sepia^ & palest
shell pink. Her rather prominent
brown eyes, almost eye-browless [?]

They drank a glass of port each, & eat ^nibbled^
then a trifle of cake with it – 
	Suddenly Phoebe Legree raised her
small drooping head. and leaned across ^The wine seemed to had^
sent a [?] colour to her cheeks. She leaned over 
the table to VandV [?] her sister’s arm.
“Cornelia,” she whispered.
Cornelia, roused from a deep fit of 
brooding, looked at her with a start.
	“What is it, Phoebe?” 
Phoebe’s lips came close to her sister’s ear. 
“Cornelia, I saw her once…She was ^I saw her^ kissing
our brother Charles.”
	Cornelia felt the blood rush to her own
pallid cheeks ^face^. She drew her arm away ^impatiently^
from Phoebe’s hand hold. “Of course – 
when he was little…She used to kiss us
all.”
	Phoebe’s mouth and eyes became three
staring circles. “Not /\ ^I didn’t mean^ when he was little.

	“Oh, well then--.” I Cornelia’s lowered ^voice sank.^
her voice. “On his death-bed. Of course. We
both saw her kiss him on the forehead.”

Phoebe shook her head. “Not on his death-
bed. Not on the forehead. And he gave it back.”
¶ Cornelia’s stare fastened itself on her
insistent face. “What on Earth do you
mean? /\ ^She lowered her voice again.^ “What sort of a kiss?” she asked
	Phoebe burst into a low [crea?] ^long crowing^
laugh: her gaunt body rocked with it. 
/|\ ^At last she said:^ “The sort of a kiss we shall ^we you and I have^ never
   had, Sister. /\ ^She had it. it was in the cold green house.^ And my brother Charles—”
	Cornelia rose abruptly from the 
table. & caught her “Our brother Charles
is dead,” she said.
	Phoebe’s head drooped again, & her
goggling eyes seemed to \|/ VshrinkV be drawn ^shrink^ back
into their orbits.
	“Come!” said Cornelia with authority.
The [??] The Phoebe rose at the
intonation. She ^Her^ older sister ^elder^ took her by
the hand, & the two sisters walked
back in silence to the cold room where

their stepmother lay, Mrs. Lepree’s her
body flat as /\ ^an^ ironing board, only her
sharp nose raising the sheet. 
	The End Cornelia Phoebe
sat down /\ ^again^ in the slippery [?] armchair, 
but Cornelia, kneeling down at the foot
of the head ^bed^, hid her face in her bloodless
hands & wept.
